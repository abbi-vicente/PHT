/* Exercise 1
Objective: Create a FizzBuzz program to practice loops and conditionals.
Instructions: Write a JavaScript program that prints numbers from 1 to 100
For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz.” */

/* Exercise 2
1. The forecast today is 293 Kelvin. To start, create a variable named kelvin, and set it equal to 293.

The value saved to kelvin will stay constant. Choose the variable type with this in mind.

2. Write a comment above that explains this line of code.

3. Celsius is similar to Kelvin — the only difference is that Celsius is 273 degrees less than Kelvin.

Let’s convert Kelvin to Celsius by subtracting 273 from the kelvin variable. Store the result in another variable, named celsius.

4. Write a comment above that explains this line of code.

5. Use this equation to calculate Fahrenheit, then store the answer in a variable named fahrenheit.

Fahrenheit = Celsius * (9/5) + 32

6. Write a comment above that explains this line of code.

7. When you convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit, you often get a decimal number. (Don't worry about this just yet). Log the temperature in farenheit to the console. */

/* Exercise 3
In this activity, the user is prompted to enter a score. Based on the score entered, the code uses conditional statements (if, else if, and else) to determine the corresponding grade. 
If the score is 90 or above, it assigns the grade 'A'. If the score is between 80 and 89, it assigns the grade 'B'. If the score is between 70 and 79, it assigns the grade 'C'. If the score is between 60 and 69, it assigns the grade 'D'. 
Otherwise, if the score is below 60, it assigns the grade 'F'. The grade is then printed to the console. */

/* Exercise 4
Create a JavaScript program that prints all the numbers between a given range. 
Prompt the user to enter the starting and ending numbers for the range. 
Use a loop to iterate through the numbers in the range. Print each number in the console. */

/* Exercise 5
Objective: Practice loops and conditionals in JavaScript
Instructions: Write a JavaScript function that finds the largest number in an array of integers */
